            I am a starting web developer, so far I've worked on a few small projects.
            I came from the North West Caucasus many years ago and I studied in a US highschool.
            I'm an ethnic Circassian; there are very few Circassians left in the world and even fewer in the US. 
            Because of this I sometimes felt a little left out since other people could always meet their countrymen, but I would never meet other Circasssians.
            I have my own personal beliefs when it comes to personal freedoms, animal rights, and laws.
            Apart from becoming a developer, I'm also interested in learning more about the stock market, law, and
            farming, and anything related to sciences like biology, chemistry etc. 
            I hope to make a business out of my developer skills. I still have much to learn when it comes to web development but 
            I think that I will be alright.
            I enjoy learning new things, watching films, hiking, swimming, and playing music on the flute.
