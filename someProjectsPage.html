            <div>
                <p>The first project is the packman assignment. The packman is animated and
                    ditects the edage of the screen.
                </p>

            <div>
                <p>The second project is the eyes assignment. Thy are animated to follow mouse movement and
                    as a small bonus I also added a nouse and a eyebrows that are symetric.

            <div>
                <p>The third project is the the realtime bus tracker assignment. 
                    The realtime bus trackers uses mapbox api and fechetches from boston bus and displays 
                    the movement of buses and requres an api token key. As a small bonus I also added a mouseover geolocation
                    indicatior and tested about few more things mapbox has to offer.

                    <p>The project that I really liked the randomwalk-paint-assignment.
                        In this assignment balls are created with mouse clicks and they are radmonly collored,
                        they ditect the edges of the given boarder and make a nice painting
